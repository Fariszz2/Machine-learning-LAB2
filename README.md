# Machine Learning Lab – House Prices Prediction

## 1. Dataset and Machine Learning Problem Summary

### Dataset Description
This project uses a house prices dataset containing information about house properties. The dataset includes features such as location, area, floor details, parking, and other housing related attributes. The dataset is used to explore data preprocessing and machine learning techniques.

### Machine Learning Problem
The task is a **regression problem**.  
The goal is to predict the **price of a house** based on its features.  
The target variable is the house price (in rupees), and the remaining attributes are used as input features for model training.
